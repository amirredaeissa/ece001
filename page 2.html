    <h3>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19).

        The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread easily between people, and scientists will continue to discover more about how it spreads over time.  The data showed that it spreads through close personal contact (within 6 feet, or 2 metres).  The virus spreads through respiratory droplets released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks.  This spray can be inhaled or put into the mouth, nose, or eyes of a nearby person.
      
        The COVID-19 virus can sometimes be spread by exposure to small droplets or mists that remain suspended in the air for several minutes or hours. This is called airborne transmission.  It is not yet known how common the virus is to spread in this way.
      
        It can also be transmitted if a person touches a surface or object contaminated with the virus and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes, but the risk of transmission in this way is low. Other risk factors associated with exposure to Covid-19 infection include:
      
        Close contact (within 6 feet or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or infected with COVID-19
        Being coughed or sneezed by an infected person.</h3>
