<h3>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency authorization for some types of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States.  The vaccine may protect you from COVID-19 infection or, if infected, severe disease.  In addition, those who have been fully vaccinated can return to many of the activities they interrupted as a result of the pandemic - without the need to wear a mask and without social distancing - except for cases required by instructions and laws.

If you haven't had the COVID-19 vaccine, you can take several steps to reduce your risk of infection.  The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend the following precautions to avoid exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19:

Avoid close contact (within 6 feet or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.

Maintain a distance between yourself and others (within 6 feet or 2 metres).  This is especially important if you are one of the groups most at risk of developing a severe case of the disease.  Keep in mind that some people may have COVID-19 and could pass it on to others, even if they don't have symptoms or don't know they have it.

Avoid crowds and closed places with poor ventilation.

Hands should be washed often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol should be used.

Wear a mask in indoor and outdoor public places where the risk of transmission of COVID-19 infection is high, such as crowded events or large gatherings.  Additional instructions regarding masks vary depending on whether or not you have been vaccinated.  Surgical masks can be used if available.  Use of N95 respirators should be restricted to healthcare providers.

Mouth and nose should be covered with an elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing.  Dispose of the tissue after using it.  And wash your hands immediately.

Avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth.

Avoid sharing dishes, drinking glasses, towels, bedding, and other household items if you are sick.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily, such as doorknobs, light switches, electronics and tables.

If you are sick, stay at home and do not go to work, school or university, as well as in public places, unless it is for the purpose of obtaining medical care.  If you are sick, avoid public transportation and taxis, including those ordered via smart apps.

If you have a chronic condition and you're one of the groups most likely to develop severe symptoms in the event of an infection, talk to your doctor about additional ways to protect yourself.</h3>
