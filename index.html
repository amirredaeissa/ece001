        <h3>Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).  A new type of corona virus has been discovered after it was identified as a cause of the spread of a disease that began in China in 2019.

            The virus is now known as "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2", and is denoted as SARS-CoV-2.  The resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it had classified the COVID-19 pandemic as a pandemic.
           
            Pandemic public health groups monitor and post updates online, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).  These groups also issued recommendations about the prevention and treatment of the disease.</h3>
